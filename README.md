<p margin-bottom: 0>I'm Nathan👋 a UI Engineer working at the intersection of design, performance, and UX. I build data-intensive web apps that turn complex information into intuitive interfaces.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I bring an unconventional background to frontend engineering: fine arts, applied mathematics, and a stint in screenwriting. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to blend analytical rigor with creative thinking and storytelling.

My focus is making powerful, data-heavy flows feel smooth for specialized users. For the past few years, I've been building FDA-cleared digital pathology software that helps pathologists diagnose diseases using AI-powered image analysis.
